# Amazavr - Online Retailer Sales Performance Analysis

This project undertakes sales performance analysis of a leading online retailer. It is designed to derive actionable insights from comprehensive inventory and sales data to support strategic decision-making in inventory management, marketing, and sales forecasting.

Research Plan
Introduction
The online retailer offers a diverse range of products â€” from Electronics and Clothing to Home Goods, Beauty, and Sports. With a global customer base and thousands of daily transactions, efficient inventory management is essential for profitability and customer satisfaction.

Objective
The primary goal of this analysis is to derive actionable insights into product and category performance. These insights will support strategic decisions in inventory management, marketing campaigns, and product development, ultimately driving increased sales and profitability.

Data Scope & Timeframe
The analysis leverages comprehensive inventory and sales data covering the period from March 2023 to October 2024. The dataset includes details on products, suppliers, sales transactions, stock levels, pricing, and other key business metrics.

Research Objectives
Top-Selling Products & Categories: Identify which products and categories drive the most sales.

Profitability Analysis: Determine the most profitable products or categories.

Discount Impact: Assess the effect of discounts on revenue.

Seasonality Effects: Understand how seasonal trends influence sales.

Sales Forecasting: Explore methods to improve the accuracy of sales forecasts.

Analytical Approach
- Data Exploration & Cleaning.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Analysis
  - Product-Level Analysis: Evaluate total sales (units sold), revenue (before and after discounts), average discount percentage, and the impact of discounts.
  - Category-Level Analysis: Analyze total sales, revenue metrics, average discount percentages, the percentage contribution of each category to overall sales and revenue, and revenue per unit sold as a profitability metric.
  - Trend Analysis: Visualize trends in sales, revenue, and discount rates over time at both overall and category-specific levels to identify seasonality, peaks, and dips.

- Modelling
Based on the insights derived from the analysis, a suitable machine learning model will be selected to forecast future sales and drive data-informed decision-making.

Report
I. Key Findings
Category Performance:

Beauty: Identified as the top-selling and highest-revenue category, driven by high sales volume and strong customer demand.

Electronics & Home Goods: Although these categories have lower sales volumes, their higher average selling prices contribute significantly to overall revenue.

Sports: Exhibits potential for revenue growth due to a higher average selling price.

Clothing: Generates high sales volume, yet produces relatively lower revenue.

Seasonality:

Holiday Season: Most categories see peaks in sales and revenue during November and December, with dips in the early months of the year.

Sports: Experiences increased sales and revenue during summer months.

Clothing: Records peaks during the back-to-school season (September) and after-Christmas sales (January).

Discount Impact:

Beauty: Highly sensitive to discounts.

Home Goods: The least sensitive to discounts.

Electronics & Sports: Discounts in these categories are less effective than initially anticipated.

II. Actions
Inventory Management:

Seasonal Adjustments: Align inventory levels with seasonal trends by increasing stock for high-demand products during peak periods and reducing inventory during slower periods.

Category-Specific Strategies: Implement tailored inventory management approaches based on sales velocity and product lead times. For instance, maintain higher inventory for fast-moving Beauty products and adjust levels for slower-moving items in Electronics and Home Goods based on demand forecasts.

Marketing Strategies:

Targeted Promotions: Develop product-specific marketing campaigns that focus on key sales periods, such as promoting Beauty products during the holidays and Sports products in the summer.

Category-Focused Campaigns: Create initiatives that address the unique trends and customer segments of each category.

Discount Optimization:

Beauty: Monitor and manage discount levels carefully due to high sensitivity.

Electronics & Sports: Reassess discounting strategies by emphasizing product features and brand value rather than relying solely on discounts.

Home Goods: Continue with the current discount approach, which has proven effective.

III. Recommendations for Further Analysis
Product-Level Trends: Investigate detailed trends within each category and perform product-specific demand forecasting.

Price Elasticity Analysis: Conduct in-depth studies on price elasticity to better understand how demand responds to price changes.

Discount Effectiveness: Optimize discount strategies by testing and analyzing different discount levels.

Advanced Modelling: Develop and implement machine learning forecasting models.

Profit Margin Analysis: Integrate cost of goods sold (COGS) data to provide a more comprehensive profit margin analysis.
